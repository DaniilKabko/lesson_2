	 <p>The modern city of Zaporizhzhia dates back to the founding of the Aleksandrovsk city, which is associated with the construction of a complex of fortresses, the new Dnieper Defense Line. The decree on its creation was signed by Catherine II in May 1770.

The construction of the Aleksandrovsk Fortress began in August 1770 on the banks of the Mokra Moskovka river, where fortress buildings and the city were laid. In the spring after the flooding of the rivers, it turned out that the place for the fortress was chosen unsuccessfully, and it was decided to build it closer to the Sukha Moskovka river.

The fortress occupied an area of 105 dessiatinas (1 dessiatina = 2.7 acres) and represented a polygonal star, created by earth banks, under which actually military buildings were located. The arsenal of the fortress was 137 guns.

In the place where the first fortress was laid down, a settlement was established, which initially had the status of a suburb, and in 1806 it got the status of the county city of Aleksandrovsk.</p>
